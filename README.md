Bug1: 

Can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone.

I'm going to use "if" to fix it, when the drop zone has been used already, it could not drop in and should back to images section. And it will say "You could not drop more than one image in the same drop zone"

Bug2:

To remove/repaint the puzzle pieces in the drop zones on reset/choosing a new puzzle, we can create a new function called resetBoard.

Select all the drop zones and remove their child elements (i.e., puzzle pieces).

Select the drag zone and append all the puzzle pieces to it.
